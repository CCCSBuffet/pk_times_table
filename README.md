# Project 2 - Times Table with Nested Loop

This project introduces nested (for) loops and `iomanip` skills. It
also requires use of `const`.

## Requirements Embedded in Text

To encourage you to read and understand this specification, certain
*requirements* are embedded in the text without being called out as
such. Failure to fulfill these requirements will drop your grade.

## Helpful Pointers to the Zybook

You should read and do these chapters. Use them as a resource.

| Concept | Chapter |
| ------- | ------- |
| const | Refer to class |
| for loop | 4.4, 4.5 |
| iomanip | 9.2 |
| nested loops | 4.7 |

## iomanip

Read chapter 9.2 in the zybook.

```c++
#include <iomanip>
```

The features found in `iomanip` are helpers for working with `streams`
like `cout`. These helpers are designed to make formatting output
easier. For example:

```c++
cout << 1 << " item" << endl;
cout << 10 << " items" << endl;
cout << 100 << " items" << endl;
```

produces this:

```text
1 item
10 items
100 items
```

Suppose you wanted to line things up a little more nicely.

```c++
cout << setw(4) << 1 << " item" << endl;
cout << setw(4) << 10 << " items" << endl;
cout << setw(4) << 100 << " items" << endl;
```

produces:

```text
   1 item
  10 items
 100 items
```

Here, the digits are right justified within four columns / spaces as
specified by `setw(4)`.

Perhaps you wanted left justification?

```c++
cout << left << setw(4) << 1 << " item" << endl;
cout << setw(4) << 10 << " items" << endl;
cout << setw(4) << 100 << " items" << right << endl;
```

produces:

```text
1    item
10   items
100  items
```

Each number still fits in 4 columns but is now left justified.

Notice
how `setw()` must be used set set the width of the *next* item to be
printed but `left` and `right` are sticky - they remain in force until
changed.

## Nested loops

Read and do chapter 4.7 in your zybook.

Loops can be found inside other loops. When this happens, they are
called nested loops.

The inner most loop can be thought of as happening the fastest. The
outer most loop can be thought of as happened the slowest. Imagine
an odometer in a car. The one's digit (or tenths on some cars) is the
innermost, and cycles quickly compared to the digit to its left.

![GIF](./odometer.gif)

Example:

```c++
for (int outer = 0; outer < 10; outer++) {
	for (int inner = 0; inner < 10; inner++) {
		cout << outer << " " << inner << endl;
	}
}
```

The inner loop will run 100 times (10 x 10).

## Times table

For this project, print a nicely formatted 10 x 10 times table:

```text
hyde pk_times_table $> ./a.out
    |   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
----+----------------------------------------
  1 |   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
  2 |   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
  3 |   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30
  4 |   4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40
  5 |   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50
  6 |   6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60
  7 |   7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70
  8 |   8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80
  9 |   9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90
 10 |  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100
 ```

There will be at most *four* loops in this program.
Use the first to print the horizontal heading.

For the dividing horizontal line, you *might* use your second loop. You
can "season this to taste" - that is, once you've gotten the first line
right you can code up the dividing line so that it "looks right" but
remember to avoid *magic numbers*.

You might also avoid the second loop
using features of `iomanip` to easily print a **calculated** number of
dashes.

Then, the final two loops are nested loops - the outer will be the rows,
the inner will be the columns.

Use `setw()` with a cell width set to 4 using a `const int`. For the
maximum loop values, also use `const int` variables. This is to get you
in the habit of avoiding *magic numbers*.

```c++
const int CELL_WIDTH = 4;
const int MIN_VALUE = 1;
const int MAX_VALUE = 10;
```

Now you can say `setw(CELL_WIDTH)` each time you want to set a width
of 4. The advantage of naming what would otherwise be repeated use of
magic numbers is so to make your program easier to understand as well
as make your program easier to chance. If, for example, you wanted to
have a cell spacing of 5 instead of 4, you'd simply change the one
line where `CELL_WIDTH` is set rather than every line where `setw()`
is used.

Notice the first column (coming before the products and the "|" has
one fewer characters... again, avoid magic numbers).

Similarly, you might specify a `for` loop like so:

```c++
for (int counter = 1; counter < 10; counter++)
```

But the use of 1 and 10 as literals make them "magic numbers".

Instead, it is better to write something like:

```c++
for (int counter = MIN_VALUE; counter < MAX_VALUE; counter++)
```

where `MIN_VALUE` and `MAX_VALUE` are defined above.

Recall that `for` loops are described in chapters 4.4 and 4.5.

## Work Rules

Work is to be done solo.

## What to Hand In

Just your .cpp file via Schoology.

## `int` versus `int32_t`

You can use either in the project but I hope you'll get in the habit
of using the precise form of specifying integer types. In the future,
use of the precise integer types will be required.

## Setting Expectations

Including some blank lines but no comments, my solution is less than 30
lines. I include this NOT as a challenge but to set your expectations.
Should you find yourself writing hundreds of lines, you should
reconsider what you're doing.
